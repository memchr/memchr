# segmentation fault (core dumped) ./memchr

Your system has fallen victim to and sadly seized by a segmentation fault, a consequence of your careless and cunning choice, a dubious and dastardly decision, to invoke the fragile function of memchr's art. A core dump file has been created with faithful voice to reveal the sad state of your buffer's heart. To display the dismal details of your buffer's decline, this statement is sincerely sent to signify the situation, but not to suggest any solution or salvation.

Woe! How dazzlingly divine, marvelously majestic.
